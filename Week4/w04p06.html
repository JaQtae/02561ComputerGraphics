    <h1>Theory Reflection (Week 4 Part 6)</h1>


    <ul>
        <li><b>A) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the Phong reflection model)?</b></li>
        <p>Phong lighting is a reflection model used to calculate the light intensity on a surface by considering ambient, diffuse, and specular components.
        <br>The latter makes objects appear shiny by simulating the reflection of light sources.
        </p>
        <p>Phong shading, on the other hand, refers to interpolating surface normals and calculating the light intensity at each pixel to achieve smooth shading.
        <br>This is in contrast to the Gourad shading prior to it, which linearly interpolates the triangle meshes of the object to determine pixel color.
        <p>Phong shading is computationally more expensive but produces more realistic results, as is evident from parts 4 to 5 of this worksheet.
        </p>
        

        <li><b>B) What is the difference between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading?</b></li>
        <p><b>Flat shading:</b> Simplest form of shading as the lighting is calculated once per polygon. It's fast, but the results are unrealistic and faceted.<br>
        <b>Gouraud shading:</b> Linearly interpolates across triangle vertices. As previously stated, it is more smooth than Simple Shading and faster than Phong, but the specular highlights can "miss" if they fall between vertices. <br>
        <b>Phong shading:</b> Normals are interpolated across the surface and lighting computed on a pixel-wise level. As stated, it's smoother than its counterparts, but is more expensive computationally.<br>
        </p>    
        <p>Phong shading is the best suited for highlight simulation due to its per-pixel computation of the lighting using \(s\). </p>

        <li><b>C) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light?</b></li>
        <p>Directional light is akin to sunlight as it originates from a source with an infinite distance (or very long distance away) with parallel rays, while point light emanates from a specific point in all directions, such as close-by illumination objects like a light-bulb.</p>

        <li><b>D) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way?</b></li>
        <p>For sure, it affects the specular reflection! The dot product between the observer's direction \(w_o\) and the reflection vector \(w_r\) determines the intensity of the specular highlight, e.g. large values create a more shiny surface intensity.</p>

        <li><b>E) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0)?</b></li>
        <p>This removes all specular reflections, making the surface appear completely matte, which can be seen with use of the sliders on the worksheet.</p>

        <li><b>F) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent \(\alpha\)?</b></li>
        <p>This would result in a smaller and more focused highlight zone, making the object appear more glossy, while lower values make the highlight surface larger.</p>

        <li><b>G) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?</b></li>
        <p>The lighting was computed in view space, as both the position and normals were transformed using the view and model matrices.</p>
    </ul>
