# 02561ComputerGraphics
This is my repository for the 02561 course at Danish Technical University in Lyngby for Computer Graphics. It revolves around WebGL/WebGPU intertwined with JavaScript to create different graphics to display on an HTML front-end. Herein I store my work, which may or may not be strictly correct nor made pretty, so view it more as a workspace.
