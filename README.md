# 02561ComputerGraphics
This is my repository for the 02561 Computer Graphics course at Danish Technical University in Lyngby. It revolves around WebGL/WebGPU intertwined with JavaScript to create different graphics to display on an HTML front-end. Herein I store my work, which may or may not be strictly correct nor made pretty, so view it more as a workspace and not as a solution.

### Github Pages links to view HTML
[Week 1](./Week1/)

### Hosting a webservice
Simply write `https-server` if node.js is installed on your unit. Other ways may be used, like dragging your html file directly into your browser, if it supports `canvas`.

### TODO:
- [ ] How to boot the repo from scratch
- [ ] Requirements.txt
- [ ] How to get said requirements (links, etc.)
- [ ] README for subdirectories
- [ ] Notes regarding usage
